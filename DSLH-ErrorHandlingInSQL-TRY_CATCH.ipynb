                "Error handling in SQL is like having a safety net for your code. Imagine you're cooking, and you want to follow a recipe. If something goes wrong, you'd want to have a backup plan or know how to handle unexpected situations. That's exactly what error handling does in SQL—it helps you gracefully deal with errors that might occur during the execution of your code.\n",

                "Learning about error handling is crucial because it allows you to write more robust and reliable SQL code. It's like having a plan for when things don't go as expected. In a real-world scenario, you wouldn't want your application to crash just because of a small hiccup; error handling helps you prevent that.\n",
