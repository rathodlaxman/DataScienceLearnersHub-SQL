                "1. **FROM Clause:** This is the first clause to be processed. It specifies the tables from which the data will be retrieved.\n",
                "2. **JOIN Clause:** If there are any join operations in the query, they are processed after the FROM clause. Joins combine data from multiple tables based on specified conditions.\n",
                "3. **WHERE Clause:** The WHERE clause filters the rows based on specified conditions. It is applied after the FROM and JOIN clauses to filter out the rows that do not meet the specified criteria.\n",
                "4. **GROUP BY Clause:** If a GROUP BY clause is present, the rows are grouped together based on the specified columns. Aggregation functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc., are then applied to each group.\n",
                "5. **HAVING Clause:** The HAVING clause filters the grouped data based on aggregate conditions. It is similar to the WHERE clause but is used with grouped data.\n",
                "6. **SELECT Clause:** This is where the actual selection of columns to be displayed in the result set takes place. Expressions and calculations involving columns can also be performed in this clause.\n",
                "7. **ORDER BY Clause:** The ORDER BY clause sorts the result set based on the specified columns in ascending or descending order.\n",
                "8. **LIMIT/OFFSET Clause:** If supported by the database system, the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are used to restrict the number of rows returned and to skip a certain number of rows, respectively.\n",
